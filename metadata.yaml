description: What should a celebrated officer do with his time once the war comes
  to a finish? In the case of Sir Reginald Fosterdyke, a renowned wing commander,
  the obvious answer is entering an airship in an around-the-world race. Will he beat
  out the other opponents, including those who are willing to cheat to be first to
  cross the finish line? Read The Airship "Golden Hind" to find out.
